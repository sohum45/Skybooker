## 🧭 Route Algorithms

SkyBooker models the flight network as a graph of airports connected by routes. It supports:

| Algorithm         | Purpose                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Dijkstra's        | Shortest path by total distance              |
| A* Search         | Heuristic-based optimized pathfinding        |
| Bellman-Ford      | Handles negative weights and dynamic graphs  |
| Floyd-Warshall    | Finds the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes |

## 💸 Pricing Model

Dynamic pricing is calculated based on:

- **Base Fare** per route
- **Fuel Costs**: ₹/liter × aircraft consumption rate
- **Operational Fees** and taxes
- **Demand-Based Adjustments**
- **Fare Classes**: Saver, Standard, Flex
